    "body": "The boom of the Second Industrial Revolution in America from 1870 through to 1920, markedly transformed the ways Americans related to the environment, from how they used it and worked with it to how they thought about it. During this fifty-year period, employment in American Manufacturing grew to 4.5 times its original force, from 2.5 million Americans employed to roughly 11.5 million, bringing with it an increase in labor power, and a demand for materials and energy as well. Public sentiments on nature and the environment of America also shifted in this era. Through the contributions of countless passionate Americans, including the storied writer Mark Twain, the photographer William Henry Jackson, the frontier historian Fredrick Jackson Turner, and the naturalists Anna Botsford Comstock and John Muir, conservationist thought began to take shape. These seemingly conflicting concepts of industry and nature came together in Fox River, Wisconsin on August 20, 1882, when Henry J. Rogers's Appleton Edison Light Company switched on the first ever hydroelectric generator. With an output of around fifty watts of power, and the capability of powering nearly 250 incandescent lightbulbs, its opening cemented Fox River in both industrial and environmental history. Not only was this a landmark moment for a novel use of natural resources to generate power, but it also set the stage for future adoption by the industrial sector. Similar hydro turbine generators were created to power a variety of amenities, from streetlights in Niagara, New York, to theatrical performances in Grand Rapids, Michigan."
